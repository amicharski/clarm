# Clarm

### Project Overview
This is going to be a Clojure compiler that compiles to ARM assembly. 
I received motivation for this project after looking at how elegant it
is to code the Clojure programming language. Although it is such an
elegant language, its runtime is horrendous. Part of the reason for this
terrible runtime is due to the fact that it compiles into the hideous JVM.
Your primary alternative right now is to use ClojureScript which compiles
into JavaScript. As we all know, JavaScript is a superfast foolproof
language which excellent performance and no outstanding problems.
